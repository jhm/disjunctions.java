# Disjunctions.java

Immutable, right biased disjunctions for Java.  The package includes two variants: Either
(exclusive) and Ior (inclusive).

In the future, this package may make backwards incompatible changes depending on the final
implementation of the following JEPs:

  * [JEP 169 - Value Objects](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169)
  * [JEP 359 - Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359)
  * [JEP 360 - Sealed Types](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360)

The current implementation makes backwards incompatible changes unlikely but this ultimately depends
on the final implementation of the JEPs listed above.
